#  Uni-variate Analysis
Uni-variate analysis is the analysis involving a single variable (‘uni’) without considering relationships with other variables. This is the stand-alone analysis of a variable/column without considering any casual relationships with other variables. We will see how a simple uni-variate analysis can help to get more insights into the data.

# Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis is stated to be an analysis of any concurrent relation between two variables or attributes. This study explores the relationship of two variables as well as the depth of this relationship to figure out if there are any discrepancies between two variables and any causes of this difference.
