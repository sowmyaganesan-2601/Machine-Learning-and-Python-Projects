# Stock Market Performance Analysis using Python
 Stock Market Performance Analysis involves calculating moving averages, measuring volatility, conducting correlation analysis and analyzing various aspects of the stock market to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect stock prices and the relationships between the stock prices of different companies. 
# APIs
API tools helps to make the program easier and simpler.API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with the necessary tools and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user. 
# How APIs work?
The client initiates the requests via the APIs URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
The API makes a call to the server after receiving the request
Then the server sends the response back to the API with the information
Finally, the API transfers the data to the client
